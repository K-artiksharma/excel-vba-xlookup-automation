# Excel VBA XLOOKUP Automation via Multi-Input Search

This project showcases a dynamic Excel VBA automation tool that performs **XLOOKUP-style record retrieval** from a source sheet based on **user input through an InputBox**. Users can input one or more **IDs or Names**, separated by commas, and the tool fetches all matching rows and transfers them to the destination sheet.

---

## üí° How It Works

1. The user clicks the **XLOOKUP button** on the `XLOOKUP` sheet.
2. An **InputBox** appears prompting the user to enter one or more **IDs or Names** (comma-separated).
3. The VBA script:
   - Splits the input into individual search terms.
   - Searches each value in the `Restaurant` sheet (source).
   - Retrieves the corresponding row(s).
   - Pastes them sequentially into the **next available empty rows** in the `XLOOKUP` sheet (destination).

## ‚úÖ Features

- Supports **multiple value lookups** in a single input (e.g., `101, 205, David`).
- Works with **ID or Name** as lookup keys.
- Auto-finds and pastes results into the next available empty rows.
- **XLOOKUP-style logic using VBA**, eliminating manual formulas.
- Interactive and user-friendly with input prompts.
- Fully documented and modular VBA code for easy maintenance.
